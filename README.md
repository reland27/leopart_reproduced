# REPRODUCTION PROJECT Leopart: Self-Supervised Learning of Object Parts for Semantic Segmentation

Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13101.pdf

Note that the data, checkpoints and masks are not included in this Github. For a better explanation of this project and the links to these files please see: https://github.com/MkuuWaUjinga/leopart

**If you also want to reproduce this table**

The PVOC data should be put in a folder 'VOCSegmentation', the checkpoints in a folder 'checkpoints' and the masks in a folder 'embeddings' for the code to work without any adjustments.

More comments and steps on how to reproduce Table 5 can be found in the accompanying PDF file.

Good luck!
